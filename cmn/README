batch_formc.py - Batch form of for_mc.py (see below).

cmn.py - A library of functions used in multiple analyses.

flymovielist.py - Takes a list of movie files and rewrites them in a format
that can be used in an ImageJ macro.

for_mc.py, for_mcgc.py, batch_formc.py - Rewrite summary files of behavioral
and gcamp data so they can be read by Matlab.

for_mcgc.py - See above.

movielist.py - Takes the data in the 'moviematch.txt' file and rewrites them
into a lsit of movies that can be used in an ImageJ macro. Used for
analysis of dtrpa1 movies.

plot_pooled.py - Plots pooled results of mutant behavioral data.

plot_pooled_wt.py - Plots pooled results of wild type behavioral data.

pool_results.py - Pools results from multiple experiments

rulercal.py - From an ImageJ-generated text file listing the lengths of a
line spanning 0.2 mm, calculates the conversion of pixels to mm. Used to
find conversion factor for the micrometer used to generate scale bars for
images taken using the Firefly MV camera.

writefiles.py - Writes different values into new files.

writejpglist.py - Writes a list of jpeg files. Used to generate the file
'list.txt' which is a list of jpegs that mplayer will play (here, first 900
jpeg files). Used to analyze the dtrpa1 movies (useful so it loads exactly
30 seconds of the movie).
