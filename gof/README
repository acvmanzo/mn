721_ttest_pumps.py - Script for calculating the p-value of pump data for 721
x dtrpa1 flies compared to controls using the ttest.

ciblib.py - A library of functions used for finding the area of the
cibarium and comparing these areas before and during dtrpa1 activation. The
input data is from ImageJ (an ROI is drawn around the blue region of the
cibarium in 3 slices). These areas are averaged. To find the difference,
the area before dtrpa1 activation is subtracted from the area during dtrpa1
activation. 

comparea.py - Script for calculating the change in cibarial area upon
dtrpa1 activation.

freqvstime.py - A library of functions used to plot the pump frequency vs.
time using data generated from ImageJ in which an ROI is drawn around the
cibarium and the mean intensity over each frame is calculated.

gfplot.py - A library of functions used to plot the dtrpa1 data (the pump
count, the cibarial area, and whether the cibarium is held open).

gof_matlab.py - Used to rewrite data for use in Matlab.

poolgofdata.py - Used to pool the pump data over multiple experiments and
genotypes.

plotgoftraces.py - A script for plotting the mean intensity of a cibarial
ROI for each movie.

plotgoftraces_1plot.py - As above but plots the selected traces onto one
graph.

poolcibarealib.py - Library with functions to pool cibarial expansion data from
multiple experiments into one file/graph.

poolcibareas.py - Script to pool cibarial expansion data from multiple
experiments into one file/graph.

poolgofdata.py - Script to pool dTRPA1 data from multiple experiments into one
file/graph.

speclib.py - A library of functions for plotting spectrograms of the data.

writecibareameans.py - Calculates the mean and standard deviation of cibarial
area data for each condition and writes them into a text file.

writepumpmeans.py - Calculates the mean and standard deviation of pump
frequency data for each condition and writes them into a text file.
