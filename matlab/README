old_scripts/ - These early Matlab test scripts were written to analyze gcamp
data and pump frequency data. I eventually wrote Python scripts to replace
these. 


batch_mc.m - Performs motion compensation of gcamp movies using DipImage. Run
from a folder containing files to be motion-compensated.

b_heatmap_dff.m - Generates a heatmap movie from a gcamp movie file for each
movie in a directory. 

b_heatmap_dff_1frame.m - Batch form of heatmap_dff_frame.m

ci_binomial.m - Calculates the Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence interval  

ci_binomial_batch.m - Batch form of ci_binomial.m

fheatmap_dff_1frame.m - Function form of heatmap_dff_1frame.m

heatmap_dff_1frame.m - Generates a heatmap image of the peak deltaf/f frame from a
gcamp movie

imaging_params.m - Sample imaging_params.m file for use in making heat maps. 

mcomp.m - Performs the matlab function multcompare on data (one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey-Kramer test to control for multiple comparisons). For use
with text files generated using the for_mc.py and for_mcgc.py functions. 

mcomp_anovan.m - Similar to mcomp.m, but performs a two-way ANOVA

mcompbatch.m - Batch function implementing mcomp.m; use from a folder with
multiple text files

mcompbatch_anovan.m - Similar to mcompbatch.m, but performs a two-way ANOVA
