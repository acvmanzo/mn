ImageJ Macros

automeasure.txt - These macros are used to measure area or intensity of ROIs,
save the results as results1.txt, save the ROIs as roi1.zip and save a picture
of the ROI. The quantities being measured depend on the macro used.

openjpgs.txt - Macro used to open multiple image sequences.

roi_mm.txt - For use with the python file 'roi_mm.py'; used for performing
multi-measure on behavior videos using pre-specified ROIs.

tifftoavi.txt - For use with the python file 'tifftoavi.py'; used to convert
multipage tiff files into avis.


Python Scripts

openser.py - Script for opening an image sequence in ImageJ that can be run
from the command line.

roi_mm.py - Script for automatically opening roi.zip files and running
multi-measure in ImageJ. Used when I have previously specified the rois
using the 'automeasure-roi only' script in imagej.
