findphase1.py - Script for identifying the maxima and minima of each
intensity trace.

findphase2.py - Script for manually correcting the maxima and minima.

findphase3.py - Script that calculates the time between each maximum to the
subsequent minimum (i.e., cibarial filling) and the time between each
minimum to the subsequent maximum (i.e., cibarial emptying). These times
are then averaged for each trace and a graph of the average filling and
emptying times is generated.

peaklib.py - A library containing functions for determining the duration of
cibarial emptying and filling.
