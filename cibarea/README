cibareacirc.py - A library of functions used to analyze the extent of
cibarial expansion. Functions calculate the mean area of an ROI drawn
around the cibarium when it is maximally expanded during each pump (i.e.,
when the ROI is largest) normalized by the width of the proboscis. ROI data
is from ImageJ and is taken from movies with a ventral view of the fly.
