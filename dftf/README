dftf.py - A library of functions used for finding the pump frequency.
Calculates the fourier transform of the mean intensity traces and finds its
peak. 

dftfbatch.py - A script that calculates the pump frequency for multiple
movies.  Generates a summary file and plots the data.

dftfbatch_gc.py - A script for calculating the frequencies in gcamp signals.

dftfcorr.py - A script for implementing manual corrections to the dft
results in the minority of cases where the wrong peak is identified.

sinewavedftf.py - A test script for calculating the fourier transform of
sine waves of a specific frequency.
