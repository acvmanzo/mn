721_ttest.py - Script for calculating the pvalue of pump frequency data for
721 x dtrpa1 flies compared to controls using the ttest.

762_ttest.py  - Same as above but for 762 x dtrpa1 flies.

droparealib.py - A script and a library of functions for analyzing the area
of a residual fluid drop left on the proboscis after withdrawal of the
capillary.  Input data is from ImageJ (for each movie, draw an ROI around
the residual fluid drop, excluding the labellum, for the frames in which
the cibarium has the least amount of fluid in it and the drop is the
largest). For each movie, calculates the area of the fluid drop for each
pump after capillary withdrawal and averages the areas at each pump.

dropintlib.py - A script and a library of functions for analyzing the
intensity of the residual fluid drop over time. Here one ROI is drawn
around the cibarium and another around the labellum, and are sized so that
they can accomodate movement of the proboscis.

lof-batch.py - For each listed experiment, runs scripts for calculating
pump frequency, ingestion rate, and volume of fluid ingested per pump.
